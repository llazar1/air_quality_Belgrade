11.3.3. Blocking 
The JVM can implement blocking either via spin-waiting (repeatedly trying to acquire the
lock until it succeeds) or by suspending the blocked thread through the operating
system. Which is more efficient depends on the relationship between context
switch overhead and the time until the lock becomes available; spin-waiting is
preferable for short waits and suspension is preferable for long waits.
